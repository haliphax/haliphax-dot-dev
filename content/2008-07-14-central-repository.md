I'm starting this blog for two reasons.

First of all, I wanted somewhere that I could (try to) keep track of all
of my programming projects/interests; sort of an "online notepad," if
you will.

Second, I figure maybe some of the problems I'm working on--or
hopefully, my solution(s) to them--might help someone else in their
endeavors.<!--more-->

I'll probably start posting examples of my experience with cross-browser
ASP/VB.NET programming in my occupation to get the ball rolling, and
eventually start writing about my ongoing game projects such as:

-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hexic</span>: A puzzle game
    developed by [Alexey
    Pajitnov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov) that I am
    re-creating in Java
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">CURSE</span>: The Cooperative
    Universal Role-playing and Strategy Engine, a project currently
    being developed as a Java client and a language-to-be-determined
    server MMORPG
-   <span style="font-weight: bold;">After The Blast</span>: a
    PHP/AJAX-driven environment where players try to survive in the
    bleak post-apocalyptic world. A nod to Fallout, done in the style of
    [Urban Dead](http://www.urbandead.com/)
