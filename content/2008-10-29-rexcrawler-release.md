I've released one of my personal software projects, rexCrawler. It is a
program I use at work to search specified files/folders for (optionally)
specified text/patterns. Knowledge of [regular
expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info) is suggested, but
unnecessary. Output can be sent to the screen, a CSV (comma-separated
values) file, or both.

You can download the file at the [rexCrawler
homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/rexcrawler) on Google Sites.

*Note: rexCrawler requires the Microsoft .NET Framework v3.5 or later.*
