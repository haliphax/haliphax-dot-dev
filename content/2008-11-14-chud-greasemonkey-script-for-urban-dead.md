I've finished putting together my first GreaseMonkey script! It's called
"chud"â€”the Caddy Healer for Urban Dead. It's been built to plug-in to my
favorite web-based zombie apocalypse, [Urban
Dead](https://www.urbandead.com/). It will bring up a list of anyone in
your map cell who can be healed with a first-aid kit, and allow you to
click directly on their name in that list to automagically heal them. I
uploaded it to [userscripts.org](https://www.userscripts.org/), the
GreaseMonkey user scripts repository. Click
