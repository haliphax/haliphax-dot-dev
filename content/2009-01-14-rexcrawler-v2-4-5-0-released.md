My complex file searching software,
[rexCrawler](http://sites.google.com/site/rexcrawler), has been updated.
Version 2.4.5.0 improves on version 2.4.4.0 by adding an instructional
help menu to the menu strip in the main window of the program. You can
download the new version in the
[releases](http://sites.google.com/site/rexcrawler/releases) section of
the rexCrawler website.
