I have released a new version of my home-grown desktop search software,
[rexCrawler](http://sites.google.com/site/rexcrawler). Several aesthetic
updates have been included, as well as tighter exception handling. Read
about it [here](http://sites.google.com/site/rexcrawler/news) or
download it
[here](http://sites.google.com/site/rexcrawler/releases/rexCrawler-2.5.0.0.zip?attredirects=0).
Enjoy!
