My first officially-recognized [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org)
widget, <u>What's My Status?</u>, has been released! It is a widget for
displaying a given user's status feed from
[identi.ca](https://identi.ca), [Twitter](http://twitter.com), or any
other service that provides a Twitter-like API. There are several
features in the works for future versions—such as inclusion and
exclusion filters—but at its core, it is a simple, effective status feed
widget that will intelligently convert @mentions, \#hashtags, and URLs
alike into clickable links. It is also prepared to cache the feed
results, so it shouldn't step on anyone's toes with regard to API access
limits.<!--more-->

Grab it over at
[wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/whats-my-status),
search for it in your WordPress installation under *Plugins » Add New*,
or view my [portfolio page](http://roadha.us/portfolio/whats-my-status).
