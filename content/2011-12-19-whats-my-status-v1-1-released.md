My microblogging feed widget for WordPress, *What's My Status?*, has
been updated. The plugin now uses `curl` for its main retrieval
mechanism, with standard URL `fopen` as the fallback. Additionally, the
*Reset cache* command has been fixed. You can [grab the
plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/whats-my-status/) for
yourself over at the [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/) site.
