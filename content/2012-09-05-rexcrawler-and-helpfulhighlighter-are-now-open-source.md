After having dipped my toe in the water of open source with some Arachni
module changes and the development of a simple WordPress
plugin, I've finally taken the plunge; two of my personal projects are now
completely open source, and hosted on [github](https://github.com). Much of
the code is stale—and somewhat embarrassing—but I figured that it was high
time I shrug off that self-defensive apprehension and use it as fuel to make
me a better developer.<!--more-->

[rexCrawler](https://github.com/haliphax/rexcrawler):
	Versatile, Windows-based file system searching tool that leverages
  regular expressions

[HelpfulHighlighter](https://github.com/haliphax/helpful-highlighter):
	Adaptive Excel 2007/2010 AddIn for visually/mentally imparied users
	that will highlight the current row and column

*Excuses and thinly-veiled self deprecation:

rexCrawler was my first .NET project (of any kind) back in 2008, and has
remained a VB.NET project to this day. (I made the shift to C\# in my
other work some time ago.) I've added a few new subtle-yet-meaningful
features over the years—and squashed some bugs—but for the most part,
its core code has never been truly refactored.

HelpfulHighlighter was written over the course of 3 days when I could
find time away from work and school in an effort to help an occupational
therapy patient being treated by my girlfriend. It served the patient's
purpose, and has been untouched since.*
