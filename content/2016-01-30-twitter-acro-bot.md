It's been a while since I actually wrote it, but I realized this evening
that I never posted about it on my blog. What I'm referring to is the
'Acro' bot for Twitter I wrote in Python.<!--more--> An acronym is
chosen at random by the bot, and then participants have a limited amount
of time to submit their definitions. Once that window closes, people
have an opportunity to vote for their favorite acronym definition (but
cannot vote for themselves). The one(s) with the most votes will be
declared the winner, and then the game begins again.
