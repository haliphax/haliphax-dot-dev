Several years ago, I wrote a series of
[UserScripts](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
for a persistent, browser-based game (PBBG) called
[Urban Dead](http://urbandead.com). These scripts tidy up the user interface
a bit and add some new features to the game that make quality-of-life
improvements to the experience (in my opinion). I abandoned them--and the
game--for several years, but I recently picked it back up again. As such, I
wanted to see how my old scripts were holding up, and for the most part, they
still worked as they did years ago! One exception was my UD Profile Expander,
which needed some tweaks to work with modern HTML standards and browsers, as
well as using GreaseMonkey's (now new to me) `@require` directive. I had been
injecting jQuery manually like a god-damned cave man.

Anyway, if you want to check out any of my other stuff, head over to my
