Well, as happens perpetually, I have neglected my blog. This time, at least, I
do have good reasons: I've been coding! Primarily, I have been developing
quality-of-life features and refactoring legacy code for [Nexus Clash], as I
have recently joined the development team. Huzzah! It is a rewarding experience
working with developers, game designers, and lore authors in an asynchronous,
far-flung, collaborative environment.

There are some topics I will be writing about soon that I have gleaned from my
work with the NC team, and there are a few others that have come from my
renewed interest in several of my hobby projects. Stay tuned!
