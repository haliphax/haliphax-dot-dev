I've built a home for all of my Urban Dead Greasemonkey scripts at
[sites.google.com/site/udscripts](https://sites.google.com/site/udscripts).
It currently houses CHUD, UDInventory, and the UDBrain Frame Fix script.
It will be my base of operations for UD mods from here on out--and I
plan to begin working with Google Gears in order to make add-ons that
can maintain configuration settings. Check it out!
