I've transferred my blog from the Blogger platform (externally hosted)
to the WordPress platform (self-hosted) for a couple of reasons. First
of all, I wanted more control over the blog on principle. Also, I needed
an excuse to become familiar with the WordPress systemâ€”and working
something into my own projects is generally the best way to learn it. :)

I've got everything pretty much organized the way that I want it, and
I've got an eye-pleasing theme in place. Hopefully, this new, more
personal online presence will spur me to post a bit more often than I
have been; I've certainly got code to spare.
