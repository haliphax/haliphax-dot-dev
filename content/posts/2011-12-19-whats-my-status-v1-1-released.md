My microblogging feed widget for WordPress, _What's My Status?_, has
been updated. The plugin now uses `curl` for its main retrieval
mechanism, with standard URL `fopen` as the fallback. Additionally, the
_Reset cache_ command has been fixed. You can [grab the
plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/whats-my-status/) for
yourself over at the [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/) site.
