My WordPress microblog feed widget recently went through another update.
This time around, I've added the ability to filter out replies and
re-posts ("retweets" in Twitter lingo, "redents" in identi.ca speak)
from your activity feed. [Pick up the new
version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/whats-my-status/) from the
[WordPress plugins site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).
