I've migrated the blog back over to my VPS, as my hosting provider has
been trying to blame me for the poor performance of my scripts on their
hosting platform. I've got everything running on my VPS machine now (and
I do mean _everything_) thanks to nginx, php5-fpm, and 752MB of RAM (of
which I am only using 49% on average).

I've got some posts in the hopper that I will be releasing soon that
deal with [easy SSL redirection for
**nginx**](/2012/05/easy-ssl-redirection-for-select-folders-in-nginx/),
[adding a discussion system to the **cgit** git web
interface](/2012/05/add-threaded-discussions-to-cgit-with-disqus/), and
[a method for **forking PHP
processes**](/2012/06/using-curl-for-parallel-php-without-pcntl_fork/)
on servers where the **pcntl** functions are unavailable.
