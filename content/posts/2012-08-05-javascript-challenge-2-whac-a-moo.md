Though I am not a proponent of the [MooTools](https://mootools.net)
JavaScript framework, [their blog](https://mootools.net/blog) is an
interesting resource that I enjoy reading. Not only is it packed with
sensible practices and interesting insights, but they have recently
begun posting JavaScript challenges where developers are tasked with
building whatever system is presented in the example.

Most recently, [the challenge involved building a "Whack-A-Mole"
game](https://mootools.net/blog/2012/08/01/javascript-challenge-2) in
JavaScript. Since I'm not a MooTools user, I decided to use pure,
vanilla JS rather than solving the challenge with another library
(namely, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)). You can [play my
result](https://jsfiddle.net/haliphax/q6r3T/) on
[jsFiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net). Enjoy!
