I've been a Vim (and gVim) user for several years now, so naturally,
I've amassed a byzantine maze of configuration settings and blessed
plugins. This evening, I decided to publicize my configuration. Check it
out!<!--more-->

There are many neat features like autocompletion, highlighting the 80th
column, a tag bar, quick folding, SublimeText-like filename searching,
navigable directory trees, easy window/tab switching, per-line git diff
status indicators, git command shortcuts, markdown support, word counts,
close-all-but-this shortcut, recently-used file list, and **more!**
