I've just finished the initial work on a script that will make a
full-HTML website, driven by AJAX, out of the MarkDown (\*.md) files in
a git repository. It's currently geared toward GitHub, but could easily
be adapted to other repository hosting services.<!--more-->

The problem I was trying to solve was that I wanted to build a web site
for a GitHub project I was working on, and I realized that I was
basically duplicating all of the content in the `README.md` file. This
would have carried on even further, as the pages I wanted to link it up
to would themselves be duplicates of other MarkDown files from the
repository. So, **repo2site** works by using AJAX and
[markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) to dynamically
build the site content from the MarkDown files themselves. When the
MarkDown files get updated, so does your site. It uses JavaScript's
`history` API in order to allow the use of forward/back browser buttons
for seamless navigation.

If you've got a git repo with some MarkDown, and you want to make a web
site out of it, look no further! (Or maybe look a little further,
depending on how complex you want to get with it.)
