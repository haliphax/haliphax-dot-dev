I've decided to abandon WordPress for my blog and switch to a static site
generator. Given my recent interest in Python, I decided to look for a
Python-based solution. I've settled on [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/).
I'm already resting easier knowing that my blog isn't a potential attack
vector, and I'm experimenting with changes to the templates for the theme I've
picked. I may go so far as to make the blog into a git repository and host
copies on my private server and [GitHub](https://github.com/haliphax).
