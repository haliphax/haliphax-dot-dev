As many nerds do, I play Dungeons & Dragons--specifically, 5th Edition. I've
mostly been a player the entire time, but I am the DM (Dungeon Master) of a
play-by-post campaign, and recently, tried my hand at a live-play campaign
that will serve as a palate cleanser for our regularly-scheduled games. In
order to bring a bit more flavor to the world I'm crafting, I decided to give
making my own maps a shot. For this, I found some pretty great (albeit
unfinished) software available on Steam called **Dungeon Painter Studio**.
I won't bore everyone with the details, but suffice it to say that it is a
pretty rad map-making tool. Here are a couple of the maps I've cranked out
lately:

I'm not sure that I'll be posting _everything_ I do on my blog, but I figured
it was at least worthwhile to post a few here and there... especially my first
foray into the hobby. Happy gaming!
