I really haven't been giving this blog the tender love and care that it so
truly deserves. I hope to change that in the near future. Then again, I know
I've said that before oh-so-many times. What's different about this time?

Placeholder post is forlorn with an air of mystery.

Edit: So, I've been doing a lot of work on a proprietary hobby web application,
and it's turning into quite a thing. I'm using Flask, socket.io, Redis (both
as a key-value store _and_ a PubSub mechanism), Celery, and Traefik in order
to build the foundation. These containers are all being orchestrated by
**docker-compose** with scalability of the web server in mind. When all's said
and done, it will be a pretty slick asynchronous interprocess architecture
scaffolding that I may split off into its own cookiecutter-type of project. I
believe I have found my next post topic.
