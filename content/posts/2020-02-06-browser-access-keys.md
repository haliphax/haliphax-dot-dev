Thanks to the [Nexus Clash][Nexus Clash] [PBBG], I have (somewhat) recently
been exposed to [web browser access keys]. I think if it had not been a web
app, such as the game, but rather a web site, such as someone's blog, I would
not have seen them for the useful tool that they can be. (See [this article
detailing a few reasons why they are less than stellar for accessibility when
consuming more passive web content][article].)

Wikipedia mentions that they are used to jump to specific parts of a web page,
but in the modern world, they can also be used to trigger various interactions.
You could have them trigger a button click, for instance, rather than jumping
to the main article or the table of contents... if your site even has such a
thing within its interface. In Nexus Clash, the access key `S` is used to
perform a search of the immediate surroundings.

Personally, I think they can be a wonderful addition to an interaction-heavy
web application. I am in the process of building a play-by-post tabletop
roleplaying game web app, and I know I'm going to be incorporating access keys
as part of my accessibility (and convenience) strategy. It is a site that,
at least ideally, the user will be returning to often; and many of the
interactions they have with the interface will be repeated as part of the core
loop. Having access keys should make that easier on keyboard users of all
abilities. I may even go so far as to make them configurable by the user as
part of their profile settings, so they can adjust them to what is most
comfortable, both physically and mnemonically.

Nothing much else to add here; no grand exposition or opinion piece. I just
stumbled across them, am planning to implement them in my own project very
soon, and figured their existence was worth reminding the world of.
