At the risk of getting a bit meta, I'm posting about the blog... not even just
about the blog, but about the blog's directory structure, configuration, and
build process!

I've just recently finished (and re-finished, and re-finished, and...) sprucing
up the README file for this blog's source code repository on GitHub. I've made
a vigorous effort to try and document the ways in which I have deviated from
the [Eleventy] standard configuration, the reasons for my deviation, and any
of the accompanying processes that drive the site.

It involves some pretty cool moving parts vis a vis GitHub Actions, GitHub
Pages, and an external cron-job service. [Go check it out!]
